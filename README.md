My project centers around the idea of creating a space for people to build their own bucket lists. My website provides a platform where users can create their lists and upload photos of their accomplishments and memories to a personal gallery.

The website features a navigation sidebar, a home page, a list page, and a contact page. The home page includes a header gallery slideshow that showcases examples of items that could be on a bucket list. Additionally, it provides a definition of a bucket list for those unfamiliar with the concept. The list page serves as the main content area, offering an input bar where users can type their goals and click 'Add' to include them in their list. Each item also has a 'x' button to delete it. To differentiate completed goals from non-completed ones, users can click on completed items to cross them out.

The gallery section includes an 'Add Drag and Drop Box' button that allows users to create as many drag-and-drop boxes as they need. These boxes enable users to upload images of their achievements. Clicking a box opens the file browser, allowing users to select images, or they can simply drag images into the box. This feature helps users reminisce about their accomplishments. Each box also has a 'x' button for deletion.
